				Use WASD to move, and left mouse button to shoot.<br>
				The objective is to send messages from one PC to the other, by playing as the packet.<br>
				Avoid enemies as they will reduce the time you have left to complete, or may even inject your packet with new letters!<br>
				Defeat the firewall boss to successfully send the message. With each new message sent, the difficulty will increase.

			<p>
				Packet Pass is a game created by <a href="https://github.com/JakeMLyons"> Jake Lyons </a> and myself as part of <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/"> Global Game Jam. </a><br>
				The theme of the game was "Transmission", so our game is based on the transmitting of data using packets.<br>
				We decided to go with a pixel/8-bit style for the art, and chiptune music as it's quite appropritate for the game objective.<br>
