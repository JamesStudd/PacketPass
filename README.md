Packet Pass is a game created by <a href="https://github.com/JakeMLyons"> Jake Lyons </a> and myself as part of <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/"> Global Game Jam. </a><br>
The theme of the game was "Transmission", so our game is based on the transmitting of data using packets.<br>
We decided to go with a pixel/8-bit style for the art, and chiptune music as it's quite appropritate for the game objective.<br>
